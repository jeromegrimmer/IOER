Illinois Open Educational Resources (IOER)

The IOER (http://www.ilsharedlearning.org) is for sharing, creating, and curating learning resources. 

This project was developed using Microsoft Visual Studio (2012+), C#, ASP.Net, and Sql server 2012. The community edition of Visual Studio (https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/vs2013-community-vs.aspx) can be used effectively for development. The site includes learning resource metadata and paradata imported from the national Learning Registry (LR) (http://learningregistry.org) and tools to publish resource data to the LR. 

Get more information about developer documentation http://ioer.ilsharedlearning.org/developers.

Key Features:

  -  Consume from and publish to the LR.
  -  Search for resources using ElasticSearch (https://www.elastic.co/)  (version 1.7.2) based index.
  -  Search filters, including a learning standards browser (e.g. Common Core, NGSS) using Achievement Standards Network (ASN) http://www.achievementstandards.org/ 
  -  Resources can be aligned to the Common Core, NGSS, Illinois K-12 standards, Illinois Adult Education Standards, and a variety of national standards.
  -  Open Libraries with collections to share and curate resources.
  -  Create Learning Lists for structuring resources ranging from small sets of learning activities to an entire curriculum.
  -  Follow Libraries and Learning Lists.
  -  Widgets (http://ioer.ilsharedlearning.org/widgets/) for seamless access to Libraries, Learning, search and more on external websites.

This project currently has just the source, database scripts and most dependent packages. Nuget can be used to download the supporting packages.

Sql scripts are included to create the databases. PLEASE contact us if you would prefer a set of small starter databases  (recommended).
