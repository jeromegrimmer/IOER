Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

In the expression xÃ‚Â² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 Ãƒâ€” 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7.

When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas.

They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others.

Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem.

They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects.

They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution.

Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas.

In the expression xÃ‚Â² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 Ãƒâ€” 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems.

When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas.

They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem. Mathematically proficient students check their answers to problems using a different method, and they continually ask themselves, \"Does this make sense?\" They can understand the approaches of others to solving complex problems and identify correspondences between different approaches.","code":"","children":[4295,4296],"id":4294,"url":""},{"grades":["5"],"description":"Reason abstractly and quantitatively.","code":"CC.K-12.MP.2","children":[],"id":4295,"url":""},{"grades":["5"],"description":"Mathematically proficient students make sense of quantities and their relationships in problem situations.

They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies. Students at all grades can listen or read the arguments of others, decide whether they make sense, and ask useful questions to clarify or improve the arguments.","code":"","children":[4299,4300],"id":4298,"url":""},{"grades":["5"],"description":"Model with mathematics.","code":"CC.K-12.MP.4","children":[],"id":4299,"url":""},{"grades":["5"],"description":"Mathematically proficient students can apply the mathematics they know to solve problems arising in everyday life, society, and the workplace.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions.

In the expression xÃ‚Â² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 Ãƒâ€” 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects.

For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator.

When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need.

Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another.

They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need.

They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas. They can analyze those relationships mathematically to draw conclusions.

In the expression xÃ‚Â² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 Ãƒâ€” 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems. They also can step back for an overview and shift perspective. They can see complicated things, such as some algebraic expressions, as single objects or as being composed of several objects.

For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator. They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem.

They justify their conclusions, communicate them to others, and respond to the arguments of others. They reason inductively about data, making plausible arguments that take into account the context from which the data arose. Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

For example, mathematically proficient high school students analyze graphs of functions and solutions generated using a graphing calculator.

When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

Noticing the regularity in the way terms cancel when expanding (x 'â€œ 1)(x + 1), (x 'â€œ 1)(xÃ‚Â² + x + 1), and (x 'â€œ 1)(xÃ‚Â³ + xÃ‚Â² + x + 1) might lead them to the general formula for the sum of a geometric series. As they work to solve a problem, mathematically proficient students maintain oversight of the process, while attending to the details. They continually evaluate the reasonableness of their intermediate results.","code":"","children":[8967,8968,8969,8970,8971,8972,8973,8974,8979,8985,9000,9020,9046,9049,9053,9059,9062,9065,9080,9081,9082,9083,9084,9085,9086,9087,9088,9089,9090,9091,9092,9093,9094,9095,9096,9097,9098,9099,9100,9101,9102,9103,9104,9105,9106,9107,9108,9109,9110,9111,9112,9113,9114,9115,9116,9117,9118,9119,9120,9121,9122,9123,9124,9125,9126,9127,9128,9129,9130,9131,9132,9133,9134,9135,9136,9137,9138,9139,9140,9141,9142,9143,9144,9145,9146,9147,9148,9149,9150,9151,9152,9153,9154,9155,9156,9157,9158,9159,9160,9161,9162,9163,9164,9165,9166,9167,9168,9169,9170,9171,9172,9173,9174,9175,9176,9177,9178,9179,9180,9204,9215,9251,9275,9296,9297,9298,9299,9300,9301,9302,9303,9304,9305,9306,9307,9308,9309,9310,9311,9312,9313,9314,9315,9316,9317,9318,9319,9320,9321,9322,9323,9324,9325,9326,9327,9328,9329,9330,9331,9332,9333,9334,9335,9336,9337,9338,9339,9340,9341,9342,9343,9344,9345,9346,9347,9348,9349,9350,9351,9352,9353,9354,9355,9356,9357,9358,9359,9360,9361,9362,9363,9364,9365,9366,9367,9368,9369,9370,9371,9372,9373,9374,9375,9376,9377,9378,9379,9380,9381,9382,9383,9384,9385,9386,9387,9388,9389,9390,9391,9392,9393,9394,9395,9396,9397,9398,9403,9409,9414,9415,9416,9417,9418,9419,9420,9421,9422,9425,9426,9427,9428,9429,9430,9437,9442,9445,9450,9451,9457,9458,9459,9460,9461,9462,9463,9464,9465,9466,9467,9468,9469,9470,9471,9472,9473,9474,9475,9476,9477,9478,9479,9480,9481,9482,9483,9484,9485,9486,9487,9488,9489,9490,9491,9492,9493,9494,9495,9496,9497,9498,9499,9500,9501,9502,9503,9504,9505,9506,9507,9508,9512,9513,9514,9515,9516,9517,9518,9519,9520,9521,9522,9523,9524,9525,9526,9527,9528,9529,9530,9532],"id":8966,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Determine probabilities using simple counting techniques.","code":"10C.6","children":[],"id":8967,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Discuss situations where permutations and combinations should be used in counting outcomes.","code":"10C.7","children":[],"id":8968,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Determine the best measure of central tendency from mean, median, or mode.","code":"10A.2","children":[],"id":8969,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Discuss how data can be manipulated to represent different points of view based on the use of different measures of central tendency and based on different graphical displays.","code":"10A.3","children":[],"id":8970,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Discuss biased reporting of data and questions that should be asked when data is viewed.","code":"10A.4","children":[],"id":8971,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Analyze graphical displays of data for possible misleading characteristics.","code":"10A.5","children":[],"id":8972,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Make conjectures about the possible correlation between two characteristics of a sample on the basis of scatter plots of the data and approximate lines of fit.","code":"10A.6","children":[],"id":8973,"url":""},{"grades":["9","10","11","12"],"description":"Students who meet the standard can formulate questions, design data collection methods, gather and analyze data and communicate findings.

They consider analogous problems, and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary. Older students might, depending on the context of the problem, transform algebraic expressions or change the viewing window on their graphing calculator to get the information they need. Mathematically proficient students can explain correspondences between equations, verbal descriptions, tables, and graphs or draw diagrams of important features and relationships, graph data, and search for regularity or trends. Younger students might rely on using concrete objects or pictures to help conceptualize and solve a problem.

By high school, a student might use geometry to solve a design problem or use a function to describe how one quantity of interest depends on another. Mathematically proficient students who can apply what they know are comfortable making assumptions and approximations to simplify a complicated situation, realizing that these may need revision later. They are able to identify important quantities in a practical situation and map their relationships using such tools as diagrams, two-way tables, graphs, flowcharts and formulas.

Mathematically proficient students are also able to compare the effectiveness of two plausible arguments, distinguish correct logic or reasoning from that which is flawed, and-if there is a flaw in an argument-explain what it is. Elementary students can construct arguments using concrete referents such as objects, drawings, diagrams, and actions. Such arguments can make sense and be correct, even though they are not generalized or made formal until later grades. Later, students learn to determine domains to which an argument applies.

They detect possible errors by strategically using estimation and other mathematical knowledge. When making mathematical models, they know that technology can enable them to visualize the results of varying assumptions, explore consequences, and compare predictions with data.

In the expression xÃ‚Â² + 9x + 14, older students can see the 14 as 2 Ãƒâ€” 7 and the 9 as 2 + 7. They recognize the significance of an existing line in a geometric figure and can use the strategy of drawing an auxiliary line for solving problems.
